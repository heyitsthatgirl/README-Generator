## Description <span id="Description">

    The motivation behind the creation of README GENERATOR was make it easier to create README files.
    Now, users of this app can focus on communicating what they want users to know about their app, without wasting valuable time on markdown.
    During the bulding process I learned that markdown files are much different than html files, though some of the same language can be used.
    Something that I think stands out about this app is the way I've written the responses to users input to sound more, well, human!
