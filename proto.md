## Description

        I wanted to make it easier for developers to create a README file for their projects.
    Now developers can focus on what they want to say about their app, without having to worry about spending extra time on markdown
    While building this app I learned that creating a markdown file is much different than bulding an html page! I enjoyed the challenge of figuring out how to style the elements.
    Something that I think sets my app apart from others is the way I've tailored the responses in the new file. I try to present information about the app while still sounding, well, human!

## Usage

    to use my app, open your terminal, navigate to the location of index.js, and run the command "node index.js". from there, answer the prompts, hitting enter after each entry. Once you have answered all of the prompts, a new README.md file will be created containing all of your answers!
